Session & cookies:- 
The main difference between a session and a cookie is that session data is stored on the server, whereas cookies store data in the visitor's browser.

The problem with sessions is that when you close your browser you also lose the session. So, if you had a site requiring a login, this couldn't be saved as a session like it could as a cookie, and the user would be forced to re-login every time they visit.
